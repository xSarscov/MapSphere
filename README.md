## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
2. A **Google Cloud API Key** with the following APIs enabled:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Maps Static API (optional for static maps).
3. **Three.js** and `@googlemaps/js-api-loader` installed as dependencies.
4. A **Gemini** API key.

---

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
https://github.com/xSarscov/MapSphere.git
cd MapSphere
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID=your_map_id
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_generative_ai_api_key
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start a local development server:

## Usage

### Controls
- **W, A, S, D** or Arrow Keys: Move your character on the map.
- **Mouse Movement**: Adjust the camera view.
- **Control Key**: Lock/unlock the camera for navigation.

### Features
1. **Search for Locations**:
   - Use the search box to teleport your character to any location.
   - The AI assistant provides additional insights about the location.

2. **Plan Routes**:
   - Input a destination in the minimap controls to calculate the best route.
   - A 3D arrow dynamically guides you along the route.

3. **AI Chat Assistance**:
   - Type questions or queries in the chat box to receive location-based insights or recommendations.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **WebGL Overlay Not Displaying**:
   - Ensure your Google Maps API key supports vector maps.
   - Confirm the `mapId` in your environment variables matches a vector map configuration.

2. **Minimap Out of Sync**:
   - Check if `updateMinimapCharacterPosition` is being called during character movement.

3. **3D Models Not Loading**:
   - Verify the path to the `.gltf` models in the `models` folder.
     
4. **API Request Quotas Exceeded**:
   - Problem: API requests fail intermittently with errors such as OVER_QUERY_LIMIT.
---

## Possible Improvements

1. **Voice Command Integration**:
   - Enable voice-based navigation and AI interaction.
2. **AR & VR Features**:
   - Incorporate augmented and virtual reality for enhanced visual engagement using webxr.
